# Uncord
Uncorded from the binds of discord.com and its TOS.

This project is not intended to be a new messaging platform like Revolt. It is intended to be a Discord backend emulator. Any kind of tools or bots made for Discord should, without extensive modification, work on the backend. The client is necessary for development, and a makes a private server compatible client available; however, there are already many clients that have this ability already (even the official browser version can manually be made to point to a seperate backend, ie FOSScord).

Current goals:

**Backend**:

* Discord-like roles and permissions system on private server instances.
* Discord-like channels on private server instances.
* E2E encryption text chat for private server instances.

**Client**:

* Text chat.
* CLI that can connect to discord.com server instances.
* CLI that can connect to private server instances.
